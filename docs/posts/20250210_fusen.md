Writing your first full R package can feel overwhelming and {fusen}
can help support at this stage. "Fusen" is a type of
[Japanese origami](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamif%C5%ABsen) in which
a flat piece of paper, when folded in a specific way and inflated, turns
into a nice paper box/balloon. Similarly, the {fusen} package inflates a
flat `.Rmd` template (which is filled in a specific way) and returns a
nice package. In this blog post, I am sharing my experience of
exploring {fusen} for the first time.

## Pre-requisites

- [RStudio installed](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/)
- [Connect RStudio to Git and GitHub](https://happygitwithr.com/rstudio-git-github.html) (_Optional, but recommended_)

## Installation and initial setup

The CRAN released version of {fusen} can be installed using:

``` r
install.packages("fusen")
```

Then we will have to create a new new project in RStudio by following:
`File > New Project > New directory > Package using {fusen}`.
This will open a `Create Package using {fusen}` wizard.
Specify the directory name and choose a {fusen} template to work with.
If you want to see how {fusen} works then select the `teaching` template
(recommended when using for the first times), else select the `full` template.
Check `Create a git repository`, `Open in new session` and
finally click on `Create Project` to create the initial structure.

In this blog we will be demonstrating how to work with the `full` template.
