# **Building an R package using {fusen}**

Writing your first full R package can feel overwhelming and {fusen}
can help support at this stage. "Fusen" is a type of
[Japanese origami](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamif%C5%ABsen) in which
a flat piece of paper, when folded in a specific way and inflated, turns
into a nice paper box/balloon. Similarly, the {fusen} package inflates a
flat `.Rmd` template (which is filled in a specific way) and returns a
nice package. In this blog post, I am sharing my experience of
exploring {fusen} for the first time.
<!-- more -->

## Pre-requisites

- [RStudio installed](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/)
- [Connect RStudio to Git and GitHub](https://happygitwithr.com/rstudio-git-github.html) (_Optional, but recommended_)

## Installation and initial setup

The CRAN released version of {fusen} can be installed using:

``` r
install.packages("fusen")
```

Then we will have to create a new new project in RStudio by following:
`File > New Project > New directory > Package using {fusen}`.
This will open a `Create Package using {fusen}` wizard.
Specify the directory name and choose a {fusen} template to work with.
If you want to see how {fusen} works then select the `teaching` template
(recommended when using for the first time), else select the `full` template.
You can also provide a name for the flat file that to be generated.
Check `Create a git repository`, `Open in new session` and
finally click on `Create Project` to create the initial structure.

## Convert a `.Rmd` file into a package

First we will follow the installation and initial setup mentioned above
(Select the `teaching` template and default name (`first`) for the flat filename.
For the directory name, I am using `my.teaching.fusen.package`)
and create a new project.

This will open a new RStudio session with an initial structure as seen in the image below:

Navigate to `dev/flat_first.Rmd` flat file and observe the different chunks present in it.
The chunks in the flat file help to set up your package:

- `description`: In this chunk, you will add metadata about your package (for example, package author, package license, etc.).
- `development`: This chunk can be used to write code for development purposes (we will not be using this for now).
- `function`: In this chunk, you will write code for a function in your package.
- `examples`: Here you would add examples of using the function which will be used for
`@examples` in the vignette.
- `tests`: In this chunk, you can add unit tests for your function.

Add the appropriate information (title, description, author(s), email(s), license) in the `description` chunk and run it. It will generate a `DESCRIPTION` and `LICENSE` files for your package.

![DESCRIPTION and LICENSE files generated after the `description` chunk in the flat file is run](images/fusen/description_license.png){: style="display:block;margin:auto;width:69%" }

There is a default `function` chunk (along with its `examples` and `tests` chunk) present in the flat file (to add one to a number). At this stage, this flat file has the minimal structure required to be transformed into a package using the function `fusen::inflate()`:

``` r
fusen::inflate(
  flat_file = "dev/flat_first.Rmd",
  vignette_name = "Get started",
  check = TRUE
)
```

If you explore the `Files` pane on RStudio now, you will notice that it looks very similar to a package structure. Notice the new directories and files have been generated:

- `R` directory: It has the `add_one.R` function file, which is generated from `function-add_one` chunk of the flat file.
- `man` directory: It has the `add_one.Rd` file generated from the `roxygen2` comments in the `function-add_one` chunk.
- `tests` directory: It has the `testthat/test-add_one.R` generated by the `tests-add_one` chunk of the the flat file.
- `vignettes` directory: It had the `get-started.Rmd` file which is generated by the `fusen::inflate()` command.
- `NAMESPACE` file: It exports the `add_one` function (provided the `@export` field is mentioned in the `roxygen2` comments in the `function-add_one` chunk of the flat file).

At this stage we have a proper R package structure - if you want to you clean up any fusen related documents from it and can also publish it on GitHub now!

You can also add new family of functions to your package using new flat template files. I will add two more functions (`squared` and `is_even`) using:

``` r
fusen::add_flat_template(
  template = "additional",
  dev_dir = "dev",
  flat_name = "squared", # and later on replace this with "is_even"
)
```

This will create a new flat file template named `dev/flat_squared.Rmd` (and `dev/flat_is_even.Rmd` when the corresponding `flat_name` is used) with the various chunks (empty) that can be populated. The chunks that I used for the respective flat files are given below:

<!-- markdownlint-disable-next-line MD033 -->
<details>
<!-- markdownlint-disable-next-line MD033 -->
<summary>Square of a number</summary>

- `function` chunk to square a number:

```` markdown
```{r function-squared}
#' Compute squared value
#'
#' @param value A numeric value
#'
#' @return Numeric.
#' @export

squared <- function(value) {
  result <- value^2
  return(result)
}
```
````

- `examples` chunk to square a number:

```` markdown
```{r examples-squared}
squared(10)
squared(73)
```
````

- `tests` chunk to test the function:

```` markdown
```{r tests-squared}
test_that("squared works", {
  expect_equal(squared(10), 100)
  expect_equal(squared(73), 5329)
})
```
````

</details>

<!-- markdownlint-disable-next-line MD033 -->
<details>
<!-- markdownlint-disable-next-line MD033 -->
<summary>Is a number even?</summary>

- `function` chunk to check if a number is even:

```` markdown
```{r function-is_even}
#' Check if a value is even
#'
#' @param value A numeric value
#'
#' @return Logical. TRUE if value is even, FALSE otherwise
#' @export
#'

is_even <- function(value) {
  result <- value %% 2 == 0
  return(result)
}
```
````

- `examples` chunk to check if a number is even:

```` markdown
```{r examples-is_even}
is_even(20)
is_even(47)
```
````

- `tests` chunk to test the function:

```` markdown
```{r tests-is_even}
test_that("is_even works", {
  expect_true(is_even(20))
  expect_false(is_even(47))
})
```
````

</details>

Inflate each of the two new flat files individually using:

``` r
fusen::inflate(
  flat_file = "dev/flat_squared.Rmd",  # and "dev/flat_is_even.Rmd"
  vignette_name = "Square of a number", # "Check if even number"
  check = TRUE
)
```

This will update the package to include the two new functions, their unit tests, corresponding vignettes and `.Rd` files, and the `NAMESPACE` (if the functions are exported) in the appropriate locations.
