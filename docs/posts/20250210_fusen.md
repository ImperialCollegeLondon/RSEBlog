# **Building an R package using {fusen}**

Writing your first full R package can feel overwhelming and {fusen}
can help support at this stage. "Fusen" is a type of
[Japanese origami](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamif%C5%ABsen) in which
a flat piece of paper, when folded in a specific way and inflated, turns
into a nice paper box/balloon. Similarly, the {fusen} package inflates a
flat `.Rmd` template (which is filled in a specific way) and returns a
nice package. In this blog post, I am sharing my experience of
exploring {fusen} for the first time.

## Pre-requisites

- [RStudio installed](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/)
- [Connect RStudio to Git and GitHub](https://happygitwithr.com/rstudio-git-github.html) (_Optional, but recommended_)

## Installation and initial setup

The CRAN released version of {fusen} can be installed using:

``` r
install.packages("fusen")
```

Then we will have to create a new new project in RStudio by following:
`File > New Project > New directory > Package using {fusen}`.
This will open a `Create Package using {fusen}` wizard.
Specify the directory name and choose a {fusen} template to work with.
If you want to see how {fusen} works then select the `teaching` template
(recommended when using for the first time), else select the `full` template.
You can also provide a name for the flat file that to be generated.
Check `Create a git repository`, `Open in new session` and
finally click on `Create Project` to create the initial structure.

## Convert a `.Rmd` file into a package

First we will follow the installation and initial setup mentioned above
(Select the `teaching` template and default name (`first`) for the flat filename.
For the directory name, I am using `my.teaching.fusen.package`)
and create a new project.

This will open a new RStudio session with an initial structure as seen in the image below:

Navigate to `dev/flat_first.Rmd` flat file and observe the different chunks present in it.
The chunks in the flat file help to set up your package:

- `description`: In this chunk, you will add metadata about your package (for example, package author, package license, etc.).
- `development`: This chunk can be used to write code for development purposes (we will not be using this for now).
- `function`: In this chunk, you will write code for a function in your package.
- `examples`: Here you would add examples of using the function which will be used for
`@examples` in the vignette.
- `tests`: In this chunk, you can add unit tests for your function.

Add the appropriate information (title, description, author(s), email(s), license) in the `description` chunk and run it. It will generate a `DESCRIPTION` and `LICENSE` files for your package.

![DESCRIPTION and LICENSE files generated after the `description` chunk in the flat file is run](images/fusen/description_license.png){: style="display:block;margin:auto;width:69%" }

There is a default `function` chunk (along with its `examples` and `tests` chunk) present in the flat file (to add one to a number). At this stage, this flat file has the minimal structure required to be tranformed into a package using the function `fusen::inflate()`:

``` r
fusen::inflate(
  flat_file = "dev/flat_first.Rmd",
  vignette_name = "Get started",
  check = TRUE
)
```

If you explore the `Files` pane on RStudio now, you will notice that it looks very similar to a package structure. Notice the new directories and files have been generated:

- `R` directory: It has the `add_one.R` function file, which is generated from `function-add_one` chunk of the flat file.
- `man` directory: It has the `add_one.Rd` file generated from the `roxygen2` comments in the `function-add_one` chunk.
- `tests` directory: It has the `testthat/test-add_one.R` generated by the `tests-add_one` chunk of the the flat file.
- `vignettes` directory: It had the `get-started.Rmd` file which is generated by the `fusen::inflate()` command.
- `NAMESPACE` file: It exports the `add_one` function (provided the `@export` field is mentioned in the `roxygen2` comments in the `function-add_one` chunk of the flat file).
