# **Logging in Python**

When trying to understand what is happening with a Python code or even when debugging, we often end up adding a bunch of `print()` statements all over the code. While this might provide some idea, it is often not structured and is a bit ad-hoc. Python's `logging` module helps provide a more structured approach to tracking events that happen when the software runs. In this blog, we discuss about `logging` and provide some examples of the same.

## Levels of logging

To begin with, we can create a logger using `logger = getLogger(__name__)` and then call the logger methods. These methods denotes the level/severity of the event they are tracking. Depending on which level is configured (default is `WARNING`), the events of only that level or higher will be tracked. Below is a list of standard logging levels:

| **Level** | **Numeric value** | **Use** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NOTSET | 0 | Placeholder  |
| DEBUG | 10 | Helps diagnose problems with detailed information. |
| INFO | 20 | Confirms that things are working as expected. |
| WARNING | 30 | Indicates either something unexpected occured or there will be a problem in the near future. The software is still working as expected.|
| ERROR | 40 | A more serious problem and the software has not been able to perform some function. |
| CRITICAL | 50 | A serious error which indicates that the program itself may be unable to continue running. |

## Handlers

Handlers are used to specify the destination where the log messages generated by loggers should go. For example, the log records maybe send to a log file, or to an email address, or even to the console. It is possible to have multiple handlers for one logger, where each handler sends messages of a specific level to a specific location.
